# 📄 Scan-Based File Sharing for Print & Xerox Shops

A simple, privacy-first file sharing platform built for **print and xerox shops**, designed to replace the everyday misuse of WhatsApp for walk-in document sharing.

Customers scan a **QR code**, share files instantly, get their work done, and leave — **no phone numbers, no app installs, no repeated hassle**.

---

## 🌍 Background & Motivation

Anyone who has visited a print or xerox shop knows the routine:

You need to print a document, so you’re asked to send the file on **WhatsApp**.  
That means saving a random phone number, finding the file, sending it, and later deleting the contact — only to repeat the same process at the next shop.

For shop owners, it’s no better. Files from customers get mixed with personal chats, documents remain stored indefinitely, and there’s no clean way to manage or organize print jobs.

This project was created to **simplify that entire experience** — for both customers and shop owners.

## 🚩 The Problem

In most print and xerox shops today:

- File sharing happens via WhatsApp
- Customers must save a new phone number for every shop
- The same process repeats every time they visit a new shop
- Shop owners receive files mixed with personal chats
- Files stay stored indefinitely, creating privacy risks
- There is no clean way to manage, name, or delete customer files

The result is an inconvenient, cluttered, and privacy-unfriendly workflow on both sides.

## 💡 The Solution

This project introduces a **temporary, QR-based file sharing system** tailored specifically for print and xerox shops.

Instead of exchanging phone numbers or using chat apps, file sharing becomes **session-based, purpose-driven, and short-lived**.

### How it works

1. The shop generates a **QR code**
2. The customer scans the QR code
3. A temporary sharing session opens instantly
4. The customer shares files, text, or instructions
5. The shop receives files with **unique, organized names**
6. Once the job is completed:
   - the session auto-expires, **or**
   - the shop owner deletes it manually

No follow-ups. No leftover data.

## 🔐 Privacy-First by Design

Privacy is a core principle of this system, not an afterthought.

- No phone numbers are exchanged
- No personal chat history is created
- Sessions are temporary and disposable
- Files can be auto-deleted or manually removed
- Customers leave with zero digital footprint

Both customers and shop owners retain control over their data at all times.
