📄 Scan-Based File Sharing for Print & Xerox Shops

A simple, privacy-first file sharing platform designed for print and xerox shops, where customers can quickly share documents using a QR code, get their work done, and leave — without WhatsApp, phone numbers, or repeated hassle.

🚩 The Problem

In most print and xerox shops today:

File sharing happens via WhatsApp

Customers must save a new phone number for every shop

The same process repeats every time they visit a new shop

Shop owners receive files mixed with personal chats

Files stay stored indefinitely, creating privacy risks

No clean way to manage, name, or delete customer files

This process is inconvenient, messy, and not privacy-friendly — for both customers and shop owners.
